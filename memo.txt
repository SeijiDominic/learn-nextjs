Pre-rendering
Generation of HTML pages in advance.
  - Static Generation: (DEFAULT)
    HTML generated at build time and will be reused on each request.
  - Server-side Rendering:
    HTML generated on each request.
  - Client-side Rendering:
    Some parts of a page can be rendered entirely by client side JavaScript. (Date Fetching)

STATIC GENERATION

  export async function getStaticProps() {
    ...fetch, then return props.
  }

'getStaticProps' will be called on build time.

You should use getStaticProps if:

  The data required to render the page is available at build time ahead of a user’s request
  The data comes from a headless CMS
  The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific)
  The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — getStaticProps generates HTML and JSON files, both of which can be cached by a CDN for performance
